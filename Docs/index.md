# World Time
World Time is a simple bot, providing users with a quick way to check the current time and day for the users in your server.

### Getting started
Invite the bot via the link on the sidebar. Once invited, the bot will only ever respond to commands. It is now ready to accept requests, and no further setup is required.

For a list of commands, see its `/help` command.

### Why would I even want to use this?
Here's a hypothetical scenario:

Imagine that you are but one user amongst many in a large community, its other users scattered all around the world. Though you feel a yearning for conversation, spurred on by a sense of boredom or unfulfillment, few seem to be available. Their statuses tease their potential existence, but they have been idle for quite some time. Surely they're around, though?

You are a courteous one, and you do not make assumptions. The concept of time zones crosses the front of your mind; different places around the world being subject to hours different from yours. You even consider for a moment the uncomfortable notion that others may have lives beyond the reaches of the internet. All of this ultimately lead to one important question burning at the front of your mind: Is this even a good time?

Oh. Well... Hm. Another time.

### Supporting the bot
World Time is free, with no strings attached. Features will never be hidden behind paywalls. This is an independent hobby project and all costs associated with it come out of my pocket, and my only interest is to provide something that I hope others find as useful as I do.

That said, this bot has ended up getting far more use than I ever expected, and the costs to keep this running have occasionally strained me both financially and time-wise. If you'd like, please consider pitching in a bit to cover my recurring costs by checking out my Ko-fi page on the sidebar.

### Privacy and Security
This bot collects and stores only information necessary for its operation, including user, server, and role IDs. As little information is stored as possible and access to the database is strongly restricted through proper security practices.

Time zones are not shared between servers *by design*, for those preferring to be selective about where they want their time zone known. Users must set their times in each individual server.

Any questions and concerns regarding data privacy and security may be sent to the bot author via the support server or by opening an issue on GitHub.
