This bot aims to answer the age-old question, "What time is it for everyone?"

Let's present a scenario: You find yourself in an online community with users scattered all over different time zones. You seek people to talk to, but they're idle. They're surely available, aren't they? You remember the existence of time zones and begin to wonder: what if this is not a good time for them?

Perhaps this bot can help with that.
