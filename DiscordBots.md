## A scenario...

You find yourself amongst a large online community, its users scattered across the land. You feel a yearning for conversation, spurred on by a sense of boredom or unfulfillment, but none seem to be available. Many people appear on the sidebar, but they have been idle for quite some time. Surely they're around, though?

You are a courteous one, and you do not make assumptions. You recall the concept of time zones, of different places around the world being subject to hours different from yours no matter the moment. You consider the uncomfortable idea that these people might also have lives of their own which do not often involve this chat platform. All these realizations ultimately lead to one important question: Is this even a good time for them?

Perhaps this bot can offer some enlightenment. What you do with this information is up to you.

## Bot details

World Time is a basic utility that keeps track of time zones registered by your users on your server. Anyone may then obtain an overview of current times and dates for users across all time zones.

This bot makes use of the IANA time zone database to determine time zones, including any Daylight Saving rules specific to a given region. Further information is provided by the help command.
