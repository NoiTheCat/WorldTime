A common problem since the beginning of the Internet: You find yourself in an online community with users scattered all over different time zones. You seek people to talk to, but they're idle. You are reminded of the concept of time zones and begin to wonder: what if this is not a good time for them?

This bot aims to answer the age-old question, "What time is it for everyone?" Users specify their time zones. Others users can then ask the bot what time it is for a person in particular, or get an overview of the most common time zones amongst recently active members.
