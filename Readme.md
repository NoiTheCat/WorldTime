# World Time

## A social time zone reference tool!
World Time is a simple bot that acts as a quick reference for checking the current time and day for the users in your server. To use it is as simple as having your users individually add their time zone, and anyone is then free to look up the full list of current times, or those of individual users.

#### Why might this be useful?
Imagine that you find yourself amongst a large online community, its users scattered across the land. You feel a yearning for conversation, spurred on by a sense of boredom or unfulfillment, but none seem to be available. Many people appear on the sidebar, but they have been idle for quite some time. Surely they're around, though?

You are a courteous one, and you do not make assumptions. You recall the concept of time zones, of different places around the world being subject to hours different from yours no matter the moment. You consider the uncomfortable idea that these people might also have lives of their own which do not often involve this chat platform. All these realizations ultimately lead to one important question: Is this even a good time for them?

Perhaps this bot can offer some enlightenment. What you do with this information is up to you.

#### Support the bot
World Time is and shall remain fully free to use. I have no plans to hide any new or existing features behind pay-only, premium features. This is an independent hobby project and all costs associated with it come out of my pocket.

This bot has had a far greater response than I've ever expected, and at this point I find it difficult to pay for the server it runs on as its resource needs grow. I would greatly appreciate if you consider pitching in a little bit to cover my recurring costs by checking out my Ko-fi page: https://ko-fi.com/noithecat.

#### Support, Privacy and Security
The support server for my bots can be accessed via the given link: https://discord.gg/JCRyFk7. A small group of volunteers who are willing to answer questions are able to help you if you have any questions.

This bot collects and stores only information necessary for its operation, including user, server, and role IDs. On occasion, data for server members not seen in some time (at least 180 days) may be manually removed by the bot owner.

Time zones are not shared between servers that this same bot may be in. This is *by design*, for those preferring to share this information with only certain communities instead of automatically sharing it to all of them. Users must register their time zone information onto every server they share with the bot for the servers they wish for it to be known in.

Any questions and concerns regarding data and security may be sent to the bot author via the support server or GitHub.
